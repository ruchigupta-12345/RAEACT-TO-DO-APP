# RAEACT-TO-DO-APP
This is a simple and functional To-Do List application built with React.js as part of my internship task for Celebal Technology. The app allows users to:  Add new tasks  Mark tasks as completed  Delete tasks  Filter tasks based on their status (All, Active, Completed)  Persist data using localStorage
